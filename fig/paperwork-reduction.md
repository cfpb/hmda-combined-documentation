According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and, not withstanding any other provision of law, a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a valid OMB control number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3170-0008. The time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average between 9,000 hours and 161 hours per response depending on the size of the institution, per response. The obligation to respond to this collection of information is mandatory per the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act 12 U.S.C. 2801–2810, as implemented by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation C, 12 CFR part 1003. Comments regarding this collection of information, including the estimated response time, suggestions for improving the usefulness of the information, or suggestions for reducing the burden to respond to this collection should be submitted to the Bureau at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Attention: PRA Office), 1700 G Street NW, Washington, DC 20552, or by email to PRA@cfpb.gov.

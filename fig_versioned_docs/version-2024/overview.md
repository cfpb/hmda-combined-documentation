Beginning with data collected in 2018, HMDA filers should report the data points described in the 2015 HMDA Final Rule and the 2017 HMDA Final Rule, as modified by the 2018 HMDA Rule for insured depository institutions and insured credit unions reporting transactions covered by a partial exemption.
